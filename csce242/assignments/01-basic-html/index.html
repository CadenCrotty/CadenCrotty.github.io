        <h1>My Top 2 Movies</h1>
        <!--Fight Club-->
        <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/qtRKdVHc-cE?si=IKMlG_05CKDj_Ojn">1. Fight Club</a></h2>
        <img src="images/fc poster.jpg" alt="Fight club movie poster">
        <p>Fight club takes the top spot for my favorite two movies. One reason is because of the feeling of suspense as the plot of the movie develops. The main reason is because of the surprise I felt at the end when the plot twist was revealed. This is a movie I wish I could watch for the first time again. It feels like they are trying to portray a meaning farther than just selling soap and causing mayhem. They wanted normal people to live and break free of their ordinary lives.</p>
        
        <!--Good Will Hunting-->
        <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/ReIJ1lbL-Q8?si=VwcCpFuVaySkcKA_">2. Good Will Hunting</a></h2>
        <img src="images/gwh poster.jpg" alt="Good Will Hunting movie poster">
        <p>Good Will Hunting is my second favorite movie because it is very thought provoking. It shows that some people just need a little guidance to reach their full potential. In the beginning Will solves the difficult math problem on the chalk board at MIT. With all the "smart" people at the school, the janitor was the one to solve the problem. This shows that some people have more talents than what meets the eye.</p>
